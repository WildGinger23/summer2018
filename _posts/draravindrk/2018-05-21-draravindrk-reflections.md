May 17th 2018 is the day that I'll remember in my life as it was my first in-class experience in the US.
I always dreamt of getting the opportunity to have an american education and it finally came true in the year 2018.
Coming from a healthcare background, I had no clue as to what computer coding was all about.
I'm glad that I took the decision to join masters at UNC-Chapel Hill.
And, I'm more than happy about the fact that the very first day of my journey at UNC started with a class taught by Elliott Hauser.
I thoroughly enjoyed every single moment that I spent in the class. To start off with, I was able to write the very first code with the help of Elliott.
It may be the most simplest and very basic but, every journey starts with a single step and moves forwad with one step at a time.
But, seeing the code getting executed was more than exciting. As the class progressed, I made a few mistakes probably out of excitement.
But, I was happy with the fact that I was able to start writing a code.
The way Elliott tries to engage every student in class into active learning is just exceptional!
I guess this style of teaching will help many people realize their potential. I'm waiting to learn more and will be looking forward to every class of Elliott.
In my opinion, Elliott is one of the best teachers that I've come acrosss in my life.
Thank You Elliott!
