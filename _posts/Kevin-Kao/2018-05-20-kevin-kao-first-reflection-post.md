This was my first time using the Github and writing the Python code. I was excited that I made a great move. 
Honestly, I am accounting major and for the past few years, I have been involved myself all in business courses or 
business environment. I have never thought that I would have this chance to learn a whole new thing. 
Python becomes increasingly popular these days, I realize that it's time to explore new things and 
strengthen my profile so I decided to learn Python. 

The first class was a little bit overwhelming. As a non-native speaker and the one who never had any experiences in coding or 
information technology, I had a little bit hard time catching up the pace. Fortunately, Elliot was so passionate and taught me 
how to use the Github step by step and let me ask questions even after the class. Now I am more familiar with using Github.

For the assigned readings, I found that it is not difficult to understand the logic behind the Python. 
The readings seem very straightforward to understand. But I am still not sure if I can absorb so much information 
in a short time. I think the effective way of learning Python is definitely to write the code on my own. 
Thus, while reading, I forced myself to write the same code on the console in Trinket to make sure that 
I truly understand it.  By doing so, I could memorize the rules easier.

The three exercises were okay with me but it still took me a while to get them right. The first one was straightforward and 
itâ€™s all about the basic concept. The second one was more advanced. I was stuck at `Pay: 96.25 `. In the beginning, I had
no idea how to combine `Pay:` and `96.25`. I tried to use `+` to combine them but it turned out to be an error. Then, I used
alternative way like this:

```
print("Pay: ")
print(float(hours) * float(rate))
```

it ended up with 
```
Pay:
96.25
```
this looks ok but is not the exact same as the required one so I had to combined them at last. Finally, I found that 
I just needed to use `,` to combine them. I never thought it's just easy to solve this problem. It took up a while for me to 
get the right one.
The third exercise is not as difficult as the previous one I think. The only different thing here is to create some words 
like `Enter Celsius:` on my own. 

Those are my reflection towards the first class and exercises. I'm looking forward to the upcoming courses!
