Observe my unremarkable turtle that uses user inputs

I want to make more complex shapes. I liked learning the proper use of syntax, particuarly

python
tina_color = input("What color should Tina be?")

This is something that would be harder to perform in Java with a need to store variables and inputs with greater syntax.
